## A Hackathon Project
This is a submission for the 2019 GUTechSoc Hackathon: Do You Have The Guts

## Premise
You play as a bored omnipotent being who's only goal is to stop as many people as
possible from getting to their destination (work, shop, their grandmas, it can be
where ever you want it to be)
