## A Hackathon Project
This is a submission for the 2019 GUTechSoc Hackathon: Do You Have The Guts

## Premise
You play as a bored omnipotent being who's only goal is to stop as many people as

where ever you want it to be)

## Under the hood
This simulation/game is written in Python 3, using pygame to render. We've implemented the boids algorithm
